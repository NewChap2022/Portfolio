## Reflection:
This is my first time to create a website from scratch. Practice is the best teacher to learn and understand coding. I gain deeper understanding of flexbox through this challenge. Especially when I was designing the applications part, it was challenging and I have to try a few times. Finally with the help of professional, I learned the importance to creating divs to meet certain needs. I want to have some more effects on my website. But my knowledge is not enough at this point of time. I will come back to this work and modify it when I have more knowledge.
